# anthropogenicDisturbance_Demo

This is a repository to run all three modules of the anthropogenic disturbance 
generation (with examples in the Northwest Territories).

Below you will find a step-by-step guide to run it. You will need RStudio or 
another software which supports `.Rproj` files:

1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the file `anthropogenicDisturbance_Demo.Rproj` in RStudio.
3. Open the file `runMe.R`.
4. Run the file line by line to get the results.

If you encounter any problems, please open an Issue with a reproducible example, 
and a detail description of your system so I can provide a bug fix.
